/**
 * verify-no-legacy.mjs — prove an FFC-EX static clone is genuinely
 * self-contained before the DNS cutover.
 *
 * The fidelity signals we had were both blind in the same place.
 * `clone-site-static.mjs` reports `remainingExternalHosts` from a regex over
 * `src`/`href` attributes, and `ffc-ex-clone-fidelity-audit.md` compares image
 * counts. Neither can see:
 *
 *   1. URLs inside HTML-entity-escaped JSON. Elementor stores widget config in
 *      `data-settings`, where a URL is delimited by `&quot;` rather than a quote
 *      character, so no `src=`/`href=` match exists.
 *   2. URLs assembled at runtime. Elementor / Essential Addons / ElementsKit
 *      build content-hashed webpack chunk URLs in JavaScript. They appear in no
 *      attribute anywhere, so no static scan of any kind can find them.
 *
 * Class 2 is why slopestohope.org shipped with its "pounds distributed" counter
 * frozen at 0 for months: the counter markup ships a literal 0 and relies on
 * `counter.<hash>.bundle.min.js` to animate it. httrack never mirrored the
 * chunk, and the clone report was clean.
 *
 * This gate is immune to both because it does not scan anything. It loads each
 * page in a real browser with every request to the legacy host aborted, and
 * fails on either:
 *
 *   - a request to the legacy host  -> a dependency survived the clone
 *   - a same-origin request that 404s -> the mirror is missing an asset
 *
 * The second condition matters as much as the first. An earlier version treated
 * same-origin failures as non-fatal and reported 13/13 pages passing while four
 * Elementor bundles were silently 404ing.
 *
 * Playwright is imported dynamically so this repo stays dependency-free; CI
 * installs it just before invoking this script (see workflow 702).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/verify-no-legacy.mjs --domain example.org --dir ../FFC-EX-example.org/out
 *   node scripts/verify-no-legacy.mjs --domain example.org --base https://example.org
 *   node scripts/verify-no-legacy.mjs --domain example.org --dir out --pages /,/about/
 *   node scripts/verify-no-legacy.mjs --domain example.org --dir out --shots /tmp/shots
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  every page is self-contained
 *   1  at least one page has a surviving legacy dependency or a missing asset
 *   2  invalid usage / could not start
 *
 * A same-origin asset the clone cannot serve is excused ONLY when the source
 * answers 404 or 410 for it — dead before the migration, reproduced faithfully
 * rather than introduced. Everything else stays fatal: an asset the source
 * serves, a path the clone itself builds (`/_next/`, `/_ffc-assets/`), and any
 * answer that merely means the origin would not talk to us (401/403/429/5xx).
 * Pass --no-source-probe to skip the check, which makes every missing asset
 * fatal again.

 * layer down.
