/**
 * convert-clone-to-routes.mjs — turn a captured static clone into an FFC-EX
 * repository with real Next.js routes.
 *
 * `scripts/integrate-clone-into-nextjs.mjs` drops the capture into `public/`,
 * which deploys — `output: 'export'` copies that directory verbatim — and
 * leaves the repo in a shape no production FFC-EX site uses. There are no app
 * routes, so the template's per-page canonicals, its `<main>` landmark, its
 * skip-to-content target and its one-h1-per-page build check have nothing to
 * act on; the charity's pages inherit none of the FFC chrome; and every page
 * the capture recorded is a file rather than a route, invisible to the whole
 * toolchain that a Next.js site is checked with.
 *
 * This script produces the shape measured on FFC-EX-catnipandcattitude.org,
 * itself a WordPress clone that was converted rather than hand-written:
 *
 *   src/clone-content/<slug>.html   the page markup, with %%BASE%% tokens
 *   src/app/<slug>/page.tsx         title, description, canonical
 *   src/lib/clone-content.ts        the token substitution
 *   src/components/{ffc-footer,clone-enhance}/
 *   public/                         assets only — zero HTML
 *
 * and on the way through it applies the corrections the capture cannot make
 * from a single page in isolation: exactly one h1 per page with no skipped
 * level (and the Divi per-module CSS retargeted to match), a description on
 * every page that has words of its own to quote, an alt attribute on every
 * image, and an accessible name on every link that wraps only a decorative one.
 *
 * Every decision lives in scripts/clone-to-routes-lib.mjs, which is pure and
 * self-tested (`node scripts/clone-to-routes-lib.mjs --self-test`); this file
 * is the filesystem around it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/convert-clone-to-routes.mjs --repo <path-to-FFC-EX-repo> \
 *        [--site-name "Charity Name"] [--assets-dir _ffc-assets] [--dry-run]

 * a duplicate-content penalty inherited from a defect in the source, not chosen

 *
 * **Different URLs that sanitize alike.** `sanitizeSlug` is lossy on purpose
 * (it strips characters a directory name and a URL cannot both carry), so two
 * genuinely different pages can want the same slug. Whoever sorts first keeps
 * the clean one and the rest are SUFFIXED, never dropped: a page silently
