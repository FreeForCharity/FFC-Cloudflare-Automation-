r"""Guard: a free-text dispatch input must not reach a script body through a
step or job OUTPUT either (#1233).

`scripts/check-workflow-input-interpolation.py` is defined over `inputs.X`.
That is the right definition for what it freezes, and it is why the same
dispatcher-supplied value can still arrive as source code one hop later:

    # job whmcs_preflight, step `meta` — remedied the house way, so the
    # sibling guard sees nothing here and is CORRECT not to
    env:
      IN_DOMAIN: ${{ inputs.domain }}
    run: |
      $d = $env:IN_DOMAIN.Trim().ToLowerInvariant().Trim('.')
      "domain=$d" | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_OUTPUT -Append -Encoding utf8

    # a later step, as 102 shipped — the value is source code again
    run: |
      $domain = "${{ steps.meta.outputs.domain }}"

Measured on the real bodies before this guard was written (#1233): with
`Metadata` fixed and the downstream site untouched, the `$( )` payload arrives
at `Metadata` as inert data, is written VERBATIM into `GITHUB_OUTPUT`, and
EXECUTES at the downstream double-quoted site — the WHMCS API secret reached a
sentinel while `-Domain` still bound a legal `example.org` and the step exited 0.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN GUARD RATHER THAN A WIDER PATTERN IN THE SIBLING
    The sibling is a pattern over one step's text: does this body mention
    `inputs.X`. This is DATAFLOW — a write in one step, a read in another, often
    in another job through `needs.*.outputs.*`, and the two are connected only
    by a name. Folding it in would put two populations behind one freeze, and
    #1210 already records what a single shared freeze costs: it serialises the
    burn-down, because two lanes cannot both edit the same pinned list. Two
    guards, two freezes, two lanes.

    They are disjoint by construction. This one NEVER reports a reference to
    `inputs.` — that is the sibling's finding, and a body that carries both is
    reported once by each for the thing that is actually its own.

WHY THE FAILURE POINTS THE FLATTERING WAY
    A burn-down lane that fixes exactly what the sibling names deletes its
    freeze entry, goes green on every check in the repo, and reports a completed
    lane that left a working injection under a production credential. Nothing in
    the tree contradicts it. That is the whole reason this exists: the remedy
    for the first hop (`env:`) is invisible to a guard defined over `inputs.`,
    so applying the remedy REMOVES the only signal anybody was reading.

WHAT COUNTS AS A SOURCE
    A step "carries" the dispatch value if a free-text input reaches it by any
    surface that ends up in that step's process — its own body, its step-level
    `env:`, or the job-/workflow-level `env:` it inherits. The `env:` case is
    the important one and the easy one to leave out: it is the REMEDIED form,
    which is exactly where a laundering hop is now most likely to start.

WHAT COUNTS AS A SINK
    An expression in a `run:` body or a `github-script` `script:` that reads a
    tainted `steps.<id>.outputs.<name>`, `needs.<job>.outputs.<name>` or
    `env.<NAME>`. Reading the same value through `$VAR` / `$env:VAR` is NOT a
    finding — that is the remedy, and a guard that flagged it would have to be
    switched off to land the fix for the thing it guards. Expressions in `env:`,
    `with:`, `if:` and `name:` are untouched for the same reason.

PRECISION, AND WHICH DIRECTION IT ERRS IN
    Taint is tracked per STEP, not per shell variable: every name a carrying
    step writes to `GITHUB_OUTPUT` is treated as carrying the value. So a step
    that holds the domain and also publishes an unrelated `out_dir` has both
    outputs marked. That over-reports, deliberately, and for the reason the
    sibling gives for its own pessimistic choices: the cost of over-reporting is
    a reviewer reading one extra name and a freeze entry saying why, and the
    cost of under-reporting is the blind spot this exists to close. A freeze
    entry is the place to record "this one is inert", not the analysis.

    Step-level `env:` taint is likewise widened to the whole job rather than
    tracked to the one step, and a `GITHUB_ENV` write to all of the job rather
    than to the steps after it. Same direction, same reason.

FAIL CLOSED
    A workflow whose YAML will not parse is a finding, never a silent skip.

THE FREEZE
    `KNOWN_LAUNDERED` pins the hops that already exist, asserted EXACTLY in both
    directions, like the sibling's `KNOWN_UNGUARDED`: a new hop fails the run,
    and an entry that no longer matches anything ALSO fails it, so a burn-down
    cannot leave the list lying.

Exit codes: 0 = the laundering set is exactly the frozen one, 1 = a new hop, a
stale entry, or a file that could not be read.

# The hops that exist today, each with the reason it is frozen rather than
# fixed. A reason per ENTRY, not per file, which is the one place this freeze
# deliberately differs from the sibling's `KNOWN_UNGUARDED`: the analysis is
# pessimistic by design (see PRECISION), so a reader has to be able to tell
# `needs.resolve.outputs.domain` — the dispatch input itself, one hop later —
# from `steps.enforce.outputs.out_dir`, which is a `$RUNNER_TEMP` constant that
# is listed only because the step that writes it also holds the domain. Without
# the reason column those two render identically and the list reads as noise,
# which is how a freeze stops being read at all.
#
# Measured 2026-09-05 on `main` `e787cd5`: 5 workflows, 28 call sites, 21
# distinct references. FOUR of these five — 101, 102, 103, 706 — are absent
# from the sibling's freeze entirely, i.e. it reads them as clean today. That is
# #1233's claim, and it is now a fleet measurement rather than one lane's
# anecdote: applying the `env:` remedy removes the `inputs.` reference the
# sibling is defined over while the value goes on being substituted into script
# text at the far end.
#
# Burn-down is tracked separately, ordered by environment, the way #1080 orders
# its own. An entry here is not an endorsement.

Remedy — the same one the sibling guard prescribes, applied at the READ:

    - name: Use the resolved value
      env:
        IN_DOMAIN_RESOLVED: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.domain }}   # not in the body
      run: |
        if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($env:IN_DOMAIN_RESOLVED)) {
          Write-Output '::error::IN_DOMAIN_RESOLVED is empty'; exit 1
        }
        $domain = $env:IN_DOMAIN_RESOLVED

The `env:` mapping is evaluated by the expression engine and arrives as an
environment variable, so the value is data rather than source code. Add the
empty check with it: an env-mapped value that is empty is not an empty argument
to a NATIVE command, it is NO argument, and every later argument binds one
position to the left (ledger L214, and `check-env-mapped-input-emptiness.py`).

Fixing the WRITE end instead — sanitising before `GITHUB_OUTPUT` — is not a
remedy. `.Trim().ToLowerInvariant().Trim('.')` removes nothing that matters, and
on a `windows-latest` job `$env:` lookup is case-insensitive, so a lowercase
payload costs the dispatcher nothing (#1233)."""
