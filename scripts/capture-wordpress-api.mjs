/**
 * capture-wordpress-api.mjs — capture a live WordPress site from its own REST
 * API plus rendered-HTML scraping.
 *
 * Why this exists alongside clone-site-static.mjs (httrack):
 *
 *   httrack discovers pages by FOLLOWING LINKS. Anything the theme does not
 *   link to — an orphaned landing page, a page reachable only from a menu the
 *   mobile breakpoint hides, a post past the blog pagination depth — is simply
 *   not in the mirror, and nothing in the output says so. The mirror's page
 *   count is an artifact of the theme's navigation, not of the site.
 *
 *   WordPress already knows the answer. /wp-json/wp/v2/pages returns every
 *   published page with an `X-WP-Total` header, so the inventory is the CMS's
 *   own count rather than a crawl's fixed point. That makes completeness
 *   CHECKABLE: captured N of X-WP-Total M is an assertion the run can fail on.
 *
 * ...and why the REST API is not sufficient on its own:
 *
 *   `content.rendered` is the POST BODY only. It carries no theme chrome — no
 *   header, nav, footer, or the CSS that makes any of it look like the site.
 *   Page builders (Elementor, Divi, WPBakery) are worse: they keep their real
 *   markup in postmeta and `content.rendered` is a placeholder or a shortcode
 *   husk. A REST-only capture of an Elementor site reproduces almost nothing.
 *
 * So: the REST API supplies the URL INVENTORY (authoritative, complete,
 * countable) and an HTTP fetch of each of those URLs supplies the RENDERED
 * MARKUP (faithful, theme-complete). Neither half is optional.
 *
 * A cPanel/FTP backup is deliberately not a source here. It hands you PHP,
 * a database dump and a plugin tree — the inputs to a rendering engine that
 * will not exist after the migration — rather than the rendered artifact that
 * is actually being migrated. Nothing downstream of this script can run PHP.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/capture-wordpress-api.mjs --domain <domain> --inspect
 *   node scripts/capture-wordpress-api.mjs --domain <domain> --out <dir> \
 *        [--max 500] [--delay 250] [--include-posts] [--timeout 30]
 *   node scripts/capture-wordpress-api.mjs --self-test
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  success (inspect: the API is usable; capture: every gate passed)
 *   1  the site or its API could not be used (inspect verdict NOT ok, or a
 *      capture gate failed — incomplete inventory, unlocalized assets)
 *   2  invalid usage / self-test failure / crash
