 * actually uses: no app routes, so the template's sitemap, its per-page
 * canonicals, its `<main>` landmark, its skip-to-content link and its
 * one-h1-per-page build check all have nothing to act on, and the charity's
 * pages inherit none of the FFC chrome.
 *
 * The production shape — measured on FFC-EX-catnipandcattitude.org, which is
 * itself a WordPress clone that was converted rather than hand-written — is:
 *
 *   src/clone-content/<slug>.html   the page's markup, with %%BASE%% asset tokens
 *   src/app/<slug>/page.tsx         a route carrying title, description, canonical
 *   src/app/layout.tsx              FFC chrome: <main>, skip link, footer, consent
 *   public/                         assets only
 *
 * This module is the pure half of that conversion: every function here is a
 * string transform with no filesystem or network, so the decisions can be
 * tested rather than inspected after the fact.

 *
 * An earlier version of this rewrote the module rule's `h1` to `h2`. That fixes

 * (a class beats an element), so a retagged heading keeps exactly the

 * document outline is the corrected one. Nothing that did not move is touched,
