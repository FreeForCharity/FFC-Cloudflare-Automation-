"""Report `agent-ready` issues whose premise has provably left the tree (#1193).

An `agent-ready` issue is a work order. #1077 stayed one for six days after
`761bfdf` fixed both causes it names, because that commit carried no
`Fixes #1077` and nothing else was watching. The cost is not the stale label:
it is that a sandboxed agent taking the top of the pickup queue gets dispatched
to fix code that is already fixed, and burns a whole run discovering that.

Why this keys on the ANCHOR and not on the file
-----------------------------------------------
The obvious detector -- "a file this issue cites has changed since it was
filed" -- was measured against the live backlog in #1193 and flagged **20 of 52
open `agent-ready` issues, 1 of them real**. Dependabot bumps and a single
comment-fix commit to `tests/workflow-logic/run_all.py` light up a third of the
backlog. At that precision the report is noise, and a report that is noise is
worse than no report, because it gets muted.

Issues in this repository quote the offending line. That quote is the premise,
and it is checkable. #1077 quotes

    .\\Update-CloudflareDns.ps1 -Zone $Domain -List -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

which is no longer in `105-manage-record.yml` (the call is now `-ExportAll
-OutputFile`), so the premise is provably gone. #1060's cited file *did* change
-- `eeee163` edited `check-pwsh-workflow-invocations.py` -- but only to make the
guard state its blind spot; its anchor is still there, so this sweep is silent
on it. **A file changing is not the defect leaving.** That distinction is the
whole design, and `tests/workflow-logic/test_agent_ready_anchors.py` pins it as
the discriminating case.

What it reports
---------------
`PREMISE MAY BE GONE`  every cited path that still exists was searched, and the
                       anchor is in none of them. Named with the anchor, the
                       paths searched, and the commits touching those paths
                       since the issue was filed, so a human has the candidate
                       fix in hand.
`PATH GONE`            a cited path that git has history for no longer exists.
                       A different and usually more serious case.

MAY, deliberately. This reports and a human decides. It never closes, labels,
comments on, or edits anything -- an auto-closer that is wrong re-buries live
work, and #1077 was closed by a Conductor holding the evidence.

The honest limits of the technique
----------------------------------
Anchor extraction is a heuristic and it is stated, not hidden. Every run prints
the count of issues from which **no usable anchor could be extracted**; those
issues are simply invisible to this sweep, and that number is the denominator a
reader needs to judge the rest. Three filters keep precision up, each of which
also costs recall:

  * an anchor must be >= 12 characters, and must not be a bare identifier or
    plain prose -- those false-positive the moment something is renamed;
  * fenced blocks tagged as a shell language are dropped whole, and so is an
    untagged fence whose first non-empty line opens with a command invocation
    (`python3 `, `gh `, `npx `, ...) -- block-level, so a wrapped command's
    continuation line goes with it rather than surviving as `--repo … --json`.
    Those are the issue's own *verification* steps, which were never in any
    file and would otherwise report on every well-written issue;
  * an anchor is reported only when it is absent from **every** cited path that
    exists. Present in any one of them means the premise is still live
    somewhere, and this stays quiet.

A cited path that does not exist and that git has no history for is a **proposed
new file** -- issues that ask for a new script name one in almost every case --
so it is skipped in silence rather than reported as `PATH GONE`.

Comparison is whitespace-normalised on both sides, so re-indenting a `run:` body
does not read as the line having been deleted.

Cost: one paginated issue listing (~1 call), plus one `git log` per cited path
that produced a finding. Bounded, local, and it does not loop.

Authentication is a single environment variable, ``GH_TOKEN`` (also accepts
``GITHUB_TOKEN``), matching ``scripts/audit-agentic-os-board.py``.

Examples:
  GH_TOKEN=... python3 scripts/audit-agent-ready-anchors.py
  GH_TOKEN=... python3 scripts/audit-agent-ready-anchors.py --json
  GH_TOKEN=... python3 scripts/audit-agent-ready-anchors.py --repo FreeForCharity/FFC-IN-ffcadmin.org --root ../FFC-IN-ffcadmin.org

Exit codes:
  0  nothing to report. The prose mode prints NOTHING on stdout in this case
     (`--json` always emits a document; a machine consumer asked for one). The
     denominators still go to stderr, so a clean run is quiet without being
     unaccountable.
  1  at least one finding, OR any API, auth or config error. **Never 0 on a
     failed enumeration**: a sweep that could not read the backlog has no
     verdict, and reporting "clean" would be the silence-read-as-green shape
     #966 is about. That covers the LOCAL half too -- a missing or broken git
     aborts, because with no history every anchor reads as unverifiable and the
     run would otherwise exit 0 having examined nothing.
