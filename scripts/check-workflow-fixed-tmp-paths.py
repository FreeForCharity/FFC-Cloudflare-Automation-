"""Guard: a workflow body must not name a fixed `/tmp/<name>` path (#1247).

Seven workflows wrote their scratch files to fixed, unqualified `/tmp` paths --
`/tmp/entries.json`, `/tmp/smoke-dispatched.tsv`, `/tmp/probes/<host>.head` and
eleven more. `tests/workflow-logic/` extracts those bodies and executes them
verbatim, so two concurrent test processes shared one file and each read the
other's half-written state.

WHY THIS IS STATIC AND NOT A TEST
    On a GitHub-hosted runner the defect is unreachable: one job per VM, so the
    paths cannot collide, and the workflow-logic suite runs its modules in
    sequence. Nothing in CI can turn red on it. It is reachable only locally,
    which is exactly where AGENTS.md's L191 treatment/control comparison runs --
    and that recipe starts the composed suite and the control suite AT THE SAME
    TIME. Same asymmetry as #929/#945/#972: a class CI cannot observe has to be
    read out of the source.

WHY IT IS WORTH A GUARD RATHER THAN A ONE-TIME CLEANUP
    The contamination is nondeterministic about WHICH SIDE of the comparison it
    lands on, so it manufactures a difference where none exists -- and that
    difference reads as a regression introduced by the PR under review.
    Measured 2026-09-07 composing #1238 + #1245 + #1246 onto `main`: `test_738`
    failed on the composed side alone. Three clean PRs looked like one broken
    fleet-drift audit; a serial re-run showed identical failure sets on both
    sides. The cost is paid in the direction of a false accusation against an
    author, which is the direction a reviewer is least likely to double-check.

WHAT COUNTS AS A VIOLATION
    Any `/tmp/` followed by a path segment, in code a runner will execute: a
    step's `run:` body, or the `script:` of an `actions/github-script` step, in
    a workflow or in a composite action.

    Reads are findings too, not just writes. A read is how the collision
    SURFACES -- 738 died on `json.loads` of a file another process was
    truncating -- and a body that only reads a fixed path is depending on some
    other body having written one.

    The remedy is `RUNNER_TEMP`, which every runner sets per job and which the
    workflow-logic harness now sets per test process (`wf_extract.runner_temp`):

        tmpd="${RUNNER_TEMP:-/tmp}"                 # bash
        const tmpd = process.env.RUNNER_TEMP || "/tmp";   # github-script / node

    Neither spelling produces the two-character sequence `/tmp/`, so the
    accepted form is not a special case in the pattern below -- it simply does
    not match. That is deliberate: an allowance written as an exception is one
    a near-miss spelling can slip through.

    COMMENT LINES ARE EXCLUDED. A `#`- or `//`-led line is prose, it executes
    nothing, and #1019 records four separate guards in 48h that flagged text
    ABOUT the thing they catch -- including this file's own CI step, whose
    explanation necessarily names the paths. The exclusion is by leading token
    only: a trailing comment on a line of code is still scanned, which
    over-reports rather than under-reports.

FAIL CLOSED
    A workflow that will not parse, a `run:` that is not a string, and a stale
    freeze entry are each REPORTED. A guard that goes quiet on what it does not
    understand reads as a pass, which is the failure this repo keeps
    rediscovering.

THE FREEZE IS EMPTY, AND THAT IS THE POINT
    The population was 22 references across 7 files and is now 0, so this fails
    on ANY instance anywhere in the tree. An entry in `KNOWN_FIXED_TMP_PATHS`
    would be an explicit, reasoned exception -- not the normal state.
