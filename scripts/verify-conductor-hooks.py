"""Verify that a privileged session actually loads this repo's hooks (#1042, #1237).

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
    Claude Code loads hooks from the **session's project root**. A sandboxed agent
    that clones this repo and opens *it* as its project root gets `.claude/settings.json`
    applied and `.claude/hooks/` run. Two populations do not, and they are the ones
    with authority:

      - the **Conductor**, whose project root is its own workspace and which merely
        `cd`s into a clone to work (#1042, ledger L218); and
      - a **multi-repo cloud worker**, which clones five FFC repos side by side and
        runs with its project root set to their *parent* (#1237). No repo's
        `.claude/` is the session config, so the hub's hooks are present, correct
        and inert -- for the very agents L218 called the protected class.

    The hub's settings spell every hook path as `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/...`,
    and `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` for either session is *not* the clone -- so the block
    never resolves and the session runs unguarded.

    The population is therefore **any session whose project root is not the repo**,
    not the Conductor alone. That correction is the whole of #1237: a finding closed
    with "a hook now holds this" is still open for whoever does the issue->PR work.

    Measured, not inferred (ledger L218, run 134): the Conductor piped a board audit
    into `tail` and read `$?` after the pipe, reported `rc=0` from `tail` while the
    audit had refused to run unauthenticated. Replaying that exact string into
    `guard_bash.py` blocks it, exit 2, naming L50 verbatim. The rule was there, was
    correct, and could not fire.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A CHECKLIST LINE
    Because the failure is *silence*. An absent hook produces no error, no banner and
    no log line -- it produces a session that behaves exactly like one whose commands
    all happened to be allowed. Nothing distinguishes "guarded and clean" from
    "unguarded" without asking, which is the whole content of #1042 AC2.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY THE LAST ONE IS THE POINT
    1. The workspace has a settings file at all (`settings.json` /
       `settings.local.json` under `<workspace>/.claude/`).
    2. One of them carries a `hooks` block.
    3. Every hook command names a file that EXISTS once `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is
       expanded the way the session would expand it -- against the workspace. This is
       the check that catches the actual #1042 defect: the hub's own settings.json
       copied verbatim into the workspace passes (1) and (2) and fails here.
    4. **A live two-sided probe of the guard the config points at.** The configured
       `PreToolUse`/`Bash` script is fed one command that MUST be blocked and one that
       MUST be allowed, and both verdicts must land.
    5. **That the workspace was stated rather than guessed** (#1237). Checks 1-4 are
       all relative to a directory, so they answer "is THIS tree wired" and never
       "is the running session wired". When the directory is merely the cwd, and the
       cwd happens to be a clone that ships `.claude/hooks/`, every check above passes
       *by construction* -- the verifier grades the config against itself.

    (5) is not pedantry about arguments; it is the #1237 false green, measured. Run
    from inside the hub clone with no arguments, this script used to print
    `HOOKS: wired ... exit 0` inside a five-repo cloud-worker session whose project
    root was `/home/user`, which has no `.claude` at all and loads nothing. The
    guard it probed was real and the probe was honest -- it was simply the guard of
    a session that was not running. A verifier written to make L218's false green
    impossible had its own, reached through its default argument. So an inferred
    workspace that ships the hooks under test is reported UNVERIFIED, never wired.

    (4) is not belt-and-braces. Config presence is not proof a hook works -- that is
    this repo's most-repeated lesson, and a verifier that stopped at (3) would be a
    fresh instance of it. The probe is deliberately **two-sided** (#1027): a guard
    stubbed to `sys.exit(0)` passes any check that only looks for a block it never
    sees, and a guard stubbed to `sys.exit(2)` "blocks" everything including work the
    routine needs. Only asserting both directions distinguishes a working guard from
    either stub.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK
    It runs the resolved hook FILE with this interpreter, not the configured command
    string verbatim -- executing an arbitrary string out of a config file is not a
    thing a verifier should do. So a command that names a real guard but neutralises
    it by other means (a wrong interpreter, an added flag) resolves and probes clean.
    The gap is narrow and the alternative is worse.

USAGE
    # verify (read-only; this is what bootstrap runs)
    python3 scripts/verify-conductor-hooks.py --workspace /path/to/workspace
    python3 scripts/verify-conductor-hooks.py --workspace /path/to/ws --json

    # render the tracked template into the workspace, then verify
    python3 scripts/verify-conductor-hooks.py --render --workspace /path/to/workspace

    # a multi-repo cloud worker: the session root is the PARENT of the clones
    python3 FFC-Cloudflare-Automation/scripts/verify-conductor-hooks.py \
        --render --workspace /home/user --hub-clone /home/user/FFC-Cloudflare-Automation

    `--workspace` defaults to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, then to the current directory.
    Only the first two count as *stated*; the cwd fallback is a guess, and a guess
    that lands on a hook-shipping clone is refused rather than certified (see 5).
    `--hub-clone` defaults to this script's own repository root.

EXIT CODES
    0  wired -- settings resolve and the guard demonstrably blocks and allows
    1  not wired, the probe did not land both verdicts, or the workspace was
       inferred and could only certify itself (#1237)
    2  usage error (missing template, unreadable workspace)

    Non-zero is deliberately the same for "no config", "config present but the
    guard does not work" and "cannot tell". All three mean the same thing to the
    run about to start: you are not known to be guarded. Distinguishing them is
    the report's job, not the exit code's.
