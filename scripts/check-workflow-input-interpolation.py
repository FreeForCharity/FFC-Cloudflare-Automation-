r"""Guard: a free-text `workflow_dispatch` input must not be interpolated into a
script body (#1080).

GitHub substitutes `${{ }}` into the script **text** before any shell or
PowerShell or JS parser sees it. So an input value is not data arriving in a
variable — it is source code pasted into the middle of a program. Two live
instances in `720-create-repo.yml`, reproduced locally before #1080 was filed:

    Description = "${{ inputs.Description }}"          # :193, pwsh
    $ Description = "$(Write-Host 'INJECTED-PWSH')"
    INJECTED-PWSH                                      <- executed

    repo_input="${{ inputs.RepoName }}"                # :274, bash
    $ RepoName='$(echo INJECTED-BASH)'
    repo_input=[INJECTED-BASH]

Neither needs a quote to break out: double-quoted `$( )` runs in both shells.

WHY THIS IS A FINDING EVEN THOUGH DISPATCH REQUIRES WRITE ACCESS
    The usual dismissal — "only someone with write access can dispatch, and they
    could edit the workflow anyway" — does not hold for a **gated** workflow, and
    that is the whole point.

    `environment:` approval is a trust boundary between the DISPATCHER and the
    APPROVER. The approver sees the run name, the input values and the workflow's
    committed source, then decides whether to spend a production credential.
    An interpolated input is code that runs AFTER that approval, inside the job,
    holding `cloudflare-prod-write` / `whmcs-prod` / `github-prod` / `m365-prod`
    credentials the dispatcher never had. Editing the workflow instead would show
    up in the diff the approver reads. An injected input never appears in the
    repository at all.

    That is also why findings are ordered by environment, not by file.

RELATIONSHIP TO tests/workflow-logic/test_no_untrusted_expression_in_run.py
    That module bans `${{ }}` in a `run:` of a workflow reachable from an
    UNTRUSTED EVENT (an issue body, a comment, a fork's PR). It deliberately
    carves dispatch-only workflows out — "no outsider can fire it" — and one of
    its clean samples asserts that `${{ inputs.domain }}` in a `run:` is NOT a
    finding there.

    This guard covers exactly the set that one declines to cover, for the
    different reason above. The two do not overlap and neither weakens the other:
    a workflow with an untrusted trigger is that module's business, and the rule
    there is absolute (no expression at all); the rule here is narrower (only
    free-text dispatch inputs), because a dispatch-only workflow interpolating
    `github.run_id` is not an injection risk.

WHICH INPUT TYPES COUNT AS FREE TEXT
    `boolean` and `choice` are excluded: GitHub constrains both to a value it
    generated, so neither can carry a payload. Everything else counts, including
    `number` — and that is a deliberate widening of #1080's own table, which
    counted `type: string` only. It is the fail-safe direction and it is not
    hypothetical here:

        101-domain-status.yml:684   const issueNumber = Number('${{ inputs.issue_number }}');

    `issue_number` is `type: number`, sitting in a SINGLE-quoted JS literal in a
    `github-script` step, in a workflow that enters `m365-prod`. If GitHub does
    not validate the type, an apostrophe ends the literal and the rest is JS with
    the job's credentials. GitHub's own documentation states that `choice`
    "resolves to a string" and says nothing equivalent about `number`, and this
    repo's CLAUDE.md records that the dispatch API requires every input to be
    SENT as a string (`issue_number: 609` is rejected 422; `"609"` is accepted).
    Absent a documented constraint, an unconstrained-by-default reading is the
    only safe one — so the type set is a DENYLIST of the two provably-safe types,
    and any type nobody has classified (a future `environment`, a typo) is
    treated as free text rather than waved through.

WHAT IS NOT A FINDING
    Expressions in `env:`, `with:`, `if:` and `name:` are untouched. The first is
    the REMEDY — `env: FOO: ${{ inputs.foo }}` then `"$FOO"` — and a guard that
    flagged it would have to be switched off to land the fix for the thing it
    guards. `if:` is evaluated by the expression engine and never becomes script
    text.

FAIL CLOSED
    A workflow whose YAML will not parse is a finding, never a silent skip — an
    unreadable file is exactly the blind spot this exists to close.

THE FREEZE
    `KNOWN_UNGUARDED` pins the call sites that already exist, asserted EXACTLY in
    both directions: a workflow (or a newly-interpolated input in an already
    listed workflow) that is not in the list fails the run, and an entry that no
    longer matches anything ALSO fails it, so the burn-down cannot leave the list
    lying. Fixing a call site therefore requires deleting its entry in the same
    PR. The list is a freeze on new instances, not an endorsement of the old ones.

Exit codes: 0 = the interpolation set is exactly the frozen one, 1 = a new
instance, a stale entry, or a file that could not be read.

# --- credential reachability (#1188) ----------------------------------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#     Judging a call site means knowing WHICH CREDENTIAL the injected code would
#     hold. The two sweeps this repo recommends for that both read the workflow's
#     DECLARATIVE surface and nothing else:
#
#         1. read the injecting step's own `env:`   — ledger L213
#         2. grep the body for `secrets.`           — the sweep used on #1141
#
#     Neither can see a credential that an EARLIER STEP IN THE SAME JOB exported
#     through `$GITHUB_ENV`. That is not a hypothesis: the #1080 burn-down hit it
#     three times, each as a fresh per-lane surprise — lane 7 (`301`, the Graph
#     token), lane 9 (`103`, the Cloudflare tokens), lane 10 (`306`, #1187).
#
#     `306` is the shape that makes this worth mechanising: the Graph bearer
#     token it mints into `GITHUB_ENV` is the workflow's ONLY credential, so both
#     sweeps answer "this workflow holds nothing" rather than "part of it". Two
#     independent-looking checks agree on a clean answer, and they agree because
#     they read the same surface.
#
#     `docs/workflow-safety-and-approvals.md` has stated the principle since #834
#     / L45-4 — "once a broad org-scoped writer token is in GITHUB_ENV, the blast
#     radius is everything that token can reach". This is its implementation.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
#     It adds INFORMATION to an existing finding. It never creates one, never
#     clears one, and never touches the exit code: a tree whose reachability is
#     empty exits exactly as it did before this landed (#1188 criterion 4).

# A name-based classifier, applied to env var names. Pessimistic on purpose, and
# for the same reason `is_write_environment` is: the cost of over-reporting is a
# reviewer reading one extra name, and the cost of under-reporting is the blind
# spot this exists to close. `IDENTIFIER` is in the list because the WHMCS API
# identifier is half of a credential PAIR — on its own it reads like metadata.

# --- credentials a step ACQUIRES rather than is handed (#1208) ---------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#     Everything above indexes ARRIVAL IN A VARIABLE — a name in the step's own
#     `env:`, a name in the job's, a name written to `$GITHUB_ENV`. That is the
#     right index for a credential somebody mapped in, and it is blind to the
#     shape a GATED job reaches for first: an OIDC login that leaves an
#     AUTHENTICATED CLI SESSION on disk (`~/.azure`, or `$AZURE_CONFIG_DIR`).
#     Nothing lands in any `env:`, nothing is written to `GITHUB_ENV`, and no
#     `secrets.` name is in reach of the body — so all three sweeps this repo
#     recommends score the step as holding nothing, while the shipped body one
#     line below runs
#
#         az account get-access-token --resource-type ms-graph …
#
#     and gets a Graph bearer token. An injected body does not need to READ
#     anything. It runs `az` itself, exactly as the shipped body does.
#
#     Measured on `main` at `b7a9f2b` (#1208): `--reachability
#     101-domain-status.yml` named 101's two `cloudflare` steps and OMITTED both
#     `m365` steps — and the `m365` job is `environment: m365-prod`, the only
#     reason 101 was a `[W]` entry in the #1080 freeze at all. Every available
#     sweep scored the two sites carrying the write environment as empty.
#
#     Why that is worth mechanising rather than remembering: the empty answer is
#     the reassuring one AND it was the mechanical one, so it is the one that
#     gets trusted. An absent line and an empty line read identically to an
#     operator and mean very different things.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
#     It does not become a finding. Like the rest of this section it is a
#     READING: it never creates or clears a finding and never touches the exit
#     code (#1188 criterion 4, restated by #1208).

# `uses:` references known to leave an authenticated session behind for every
# LATER step of the caller's job. First match wins, so the generic `*/…login…@`
# row sits last: it is the catch-all that keeps an unfamiliar login action from
# reading as "no credential" — the failure this whole block exists to end.
#
# Third-party sources are not in this tree, so this is a NAME-based judgement in
# a file that otherwise refuses to guess at a third-party `uses:`
# (`action_exported_env_names` returns nothing for one, deliberately). The
# asymmetry is the point and it runs the safe way: naming a session that turns
# out to be unused costs a reviewer one line, and the opposite error is #1208.
#
# WHAT DOES *NOT* BELONG HERE, AND THE LINE IT DRAWS
#     Every row above leaves state a later step inherits with no mapping of any
#     kind — `~/.azure`, a credentials file plus `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`,
#     the `AWS_*` job env, `~/.docker/config.json`. That is what makes "in the
#     process environment of the later step" true of them.
#
#     `actions/create-github-app-token@…` is NOT one, and #1208's proposal listed
#     it with the qualifier "where the token is consumed from a step output".
#     It hands back `steps.<id>.outputs.token` and leaves nothing ambient, so
#     reporting it here would assert the one thing this whole section exists to
#     get right — the ARRIVAL PATH — incorrectly, in the flattering-looking
#     direction of a longer list. Neither of its real shapes is lost by the
#     omission: mapped into a later `env:` it is already reported as `step env:`
#     (the name matches `_CREDENTIAL_NAME`), and interpolated straight into a
#     body it is not "in reach" at all but literally pasted into the source,
#     which is a #1080 finding rather than a reachability line. Resolving the
#     output-consumption case properly means indexing `steps.<id>.outputs`
#     references, which nothing here does yet. Raised by review on #1219.

#
#   +1 write  229-whmcs-client-field-populate.yml — #825 landed 2026-08-05

    # from the rendered arguments and `-Domain` swallowed the next token. Measured
    # on the pre-fix body with the dispatch box blanked, 3 of 8 runs bound
    # `Domain=[-DryRun:True]` with `DryRun=[False]` and exited 0; the other 5 failed
    # loudly on the mandatory parameter. Same input, same commit, two outcomes.

    # `cloudflare-tokens-from-kv` — see `--reachability` for the path (#1188).
    #
    # The lane the OTHER lanes' remedy does not fit: `domains` is `required: false`
    # with an empty default and a documented fallback to a 13-domain list, so a
    # fail-closed guard on empty would break the common path. It keeps the fallback
    # (a "default fill" guard, #1150) and omits `Target` from the splat when blank
    # rather than passing an empty string, because the callee already resolves the
    # canonical Pages host (#778) and a second copy of it would drift. `dry_run`

    # 120-bulk-cutover-to-github-pages.yml burned down: `domains` now reaches all four
    # bodies (two pwsh, two bash) through step-level `env:`. It held two write

    # 301-m365-domain-preflight.yml burned down: `domain` now reaches both pwsh
    # bodies through step-level `env:`. Its two call sites sit in TWO jobs under
    # TWO environments — `graph` on m365-prod and `cloudflare` on
    # cloudflare-prod-read, the second `needs:` the first — so one payload in one
    # dispatch ran in both. What distinguishes it from 303/304 is what sat in the
    # first injection point's own `env:`: not a `secrets.*` value but
    # GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN, a live Microsoft Graph bearer token mapped from a step
    # OUTPUT. A sweep of the file for `secrets.` in a `run:` body — the scope test
    # #1141's review recommended for the remaining lanes — finds nothing there.
    # The second site inherits the Key Vault Cloudflare tokens the composite
    # action loads, which are not in any `env:` block at all.
    # 303-m365-domain-and-dkim.yml burned down: `domain` now reaches both pwsh
    # bodies through step-level `env:`. Its two call sites sit in ONE job on
    # m365-prod, and the credential exposure is broader than 304's rather than
    # narrower: the JOB-level `env:` maps EXO_CERT_PFX_BASE64 and
    # EXO_CERT_PFX_PASSWORD, so the Exchange Online certificate and its password
    # were in the process environment of BOTH injection points — including the
    # `status` step, which reads as the harmless half of the workflow. The DKIM
    # step adds EXO_APP_ID / EXO_TENANT / EXO_ORGANIZATION in its own `env:`
    # (ledger L213). `action` and `create_if_missing` are still interpolated and
    # are NOT findings: GitHub constrains a `choice` and a `boolean` to a value it
    # generated, so neither can carry a payload.
    # 304-m365-dkim-enable.yml burned down: `domain` now reaches all three bodies
    # through step-level `env:`. It was the only remaining entry interpolating one
    # input into three jobs under two gated environments — m365-prod twice and
    # cloudflare-prod-write once — so a payload ran three times, under two credentials,
    # on one approval. Sharper than the neighbouring entries in WHERE the credential
    # sat: both m365-prod steps carry FFC_EXO_CERT_PFX_BASE64 / FFC_EXO_CERT_PASSWORD
    # in the SAME step's `env:` as the injection point, so the Exchange Online
    # certificate was already in the process environment of the body being injected
    # into. Measured against the shipped body: the cert password was written to a file,
    # m365-dkim.ps1 was then called with a legal `Domain=[ffcworkingsite1.org]`, and the
    # step exited 0.
    # 306-discover-uncaptured-comms.yml burned down: `mailboxes` / `since_days` now
    # reach the pwsh body through step-level `env:`. Two things distinguish it from
    # the other m365-prod lanes. First, the credential in reach appears NOWHERE in
    # the file: the preceding step mints a Graph bearer token from the OIDC login and
    # exports it through GITHUB_ENV, so both recommended sweeps — read the step's own
    # `env:` (L213), grep the body for `secrets.` (#1141) — score this workflow as
    # holding nothing, and it is the workflow's ONLY credential. This lane is why
    # #1188 exists: `--reachability 306-discover-uncaptured-comms.yml` answers it
    # in one call instead of a third per-lane rediscovery. Second, it is the
    # first lane whose injection point sat in SINGLE quotes, where `$( )` does not
    # expand: the payload every earlier lane used is inert here and reports the
    # pre-fix body as harmless, so the control had to close the quote, steal, and
    # re-issue the legitimate call. Measured against the shipped body that way: the
    # bearer token was written to a file, the scanner was then invoked with a legal
    # mailbox list, and the step exited 0. Both inputs carry a `default:` and neither
    # declares a `type:`, so both are plain strings — a pre-filled box is not a
    # constraint.
