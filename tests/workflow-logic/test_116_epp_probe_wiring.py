"""Unit tests for 116's two dispatch-input call sites (#1080 burn-down).

116 probes whether a domain's EPP/auth transfer code comes back inline from the
WHMCS API or is only emailed to the registrant, under the gated `whmcs-prod`
environment. Its one free-text dispatch input, `domain`, used to be interpolated
into the single pwsh body TWICE — once into the variable the splat is built from
and once into the job-summary line. Both now read `$env:IN_DOMAIN` / the local
`$domain` it is copied into.

TWO CALL SITES, ONE FREEZE ENTRY
    `KNOWN_UNGUARDED` records an input NAME per workflow, not a count, so
    `("domain",)` was one entry covering two substitution points. A lane that
    fixed only the assignment would have satisfied a reading of the entry and
    left the summary line executing dispatcher text — which is why
    `test_the_body_has_no_remaining_domain_interpolation` is written over the
    checker's own patterns rather than over a count this module chose.

WHERE THE CREDENTIAL SAT — INVISIBLE TO BOTH RECOMMENDED SWEEPS
    The WHMCS API credential (`WHMCS_API_IDENTIFIER` / `WHMCS_API_SECRET` /
    `WHMCS_APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`) is minted by the PRECEDING step,
    `uses: ./.github/actions/whmcs-secrets-from-kv`, which exports it through
    GITHUB_ENV. It is therefore in the process environment of the injection point
    while appearing in no `env:` block in this file and matching no `secrets.`
    reference, so an L213 `env:` read and the #1141 `secrets.` grep both score
    the file as holding nothing. It is also the workflow's ONLY credential.

THE INJECTION POINT SAT IN DOUBLE QUOTES — NO BREAKOUT WAS NEEDED
    Unlike 118, whose single-quoted site made the `$( )` payload inert and
    required closing the string and the hashtable, pwsh expands subexpressions
    inside double quotes. So the payload is a plain suffix on a legal value:

        domain = example.org$($null = Set-Content -Path <sentinel> -Value $env:WHMCS_API_SECRET)

    `$null =` swallows the subexpression's output, so `$domain` keeps the value
    `example.org` and nothing in the log looks unusual. Measured against the body
    as it shipped, on pwsh 7.4.6:

        * the WHMCS API secret was written to the sentinel file;
        * the callee was then invoked with `Domain=[example.org]`, `Execute` and
          `ShowCode` intact;
        * the step exited **0**, under `whmcs-prod`, after the approval.

THIS LANE BOUNDS L214 RATHER THAN RE-CONFIRMING IT
    Every earlier lane added `IsNullOrWhiteSpace` to close a hazard the REMEDY
    manufactures: moving a value into `env:` lets an unset mapping vanish from a
    native command's argument list, so `-Domain` binds the next token and
    everything shifts one position left (#1150, ledger L214).

    That does not happen here, and the difference was measured rather than
    inherited. 116 splats an ARRAY whose only other elements are SWITCHES
    (`-Execute`, `-ShowCode`), and a switch cannot absorb a value — so there is
    no plausible-looking call for the blank to shift into. With the guard
    stripped, on pwsh 7.4.6, both call forms and both blank states:

        unset     `Missing an argument for parameter 'Domain'.`      rc 1
        empty ''  `Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Domain'
                   because it is an empty string.`                   rc 1

    Loud, deterministic, and harmless in both directions — none of the
    3-of-8-runs nondeterminism 118 measured. The guard is still correct to add,
    for a different and smaller reason: it attributes the fault to the missing or
    misnamed `env:` mapping at the step that owns it, instead of surfacing as a
    binder error naming the callee. `test_without_the_guard_a_blank_fails_loudly`
    pins the bound so the next lane does not restate 118's claim about a body
    whose shape does not support it. Ledger L260.
