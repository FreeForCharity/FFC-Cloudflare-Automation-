"""Tests for the free-text dispatch-input interpolation guard (#1080).

The subject is `scripts/check-workflow-input-interpolation.py`. What it claims:
a `workflow_dispatch` input the dispatcher types freely never reaches a `run:`
or `github-script` body through `${{ }}`, except for the call sites frozen in
`KNOWN_UNGUARDED` — and that freeze is exact in both directions.

The two failure modes worth designing against, both seen in this repo before:

* **Vacuous green.** A sweep whose input set silently empties passes by
  inspecting nothing. `test_the_scan_sees_real_workflows` and
  `test_the_free_text_set_is_not_empty` pin the input, and every helper that
  filters is given a positive control before anything is built on it.
* **A guard that cannot fail.** Reading the checker proves it is wired, never
  that it detects (AGENTS.md). So the tree-level assertions are backed by
  mutations: each acceptance criterion of #1080 that says "X makes it exit 1"
  is exercised by actually doing X.

The false-positive surface gets its own module-level attention, because
`env:` is the REMEDY for this defect — a guard that flagged it would have to be
switched off to land the fix for the thing it guards (ledger L27).

               credential exposure is broader than 304's rather than narrower:
               the JOB-level `env:` maps EXO_CERT_PFX_BASE64 and
               EXO_CERT_PFX_PASSWORD, so the certificate was in the process
               environment of both injection points — including the `status`
               step, which maps no secret of its own and reads as the harmless
               half of the workflow. Measured from that step: the payload wrote
               the cert password to a file, the callee was handed a legal
               domain, and the step exited 0.
      = 30 / 15

               the second `needs:` the first — so one payload in one dispatch
               ran in both. What distinguishes it from 303/304 is what sat in
               the first injection point's own `env:`: not a value from the
               secrets store but GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN, a live Microsoft Graph
               bearer token mapped from a step OUTPUT, which a sweep of the
               file for secret references does not see. The second site
               inherits the Key Vault Cloudflare tokens the composite action
               exports through GITHUB_ENV, which appear in no `env:` block at
               all. Measured at both: the payload wrote the credential to a
               file, the callee was handed a legal domain, and the step exited
               0.
      = 29 / 14
      -110     burned down: `domain` moved to step-level `env:` at BOTH branches
               of the step's `jump_start` conditional — two call sites in one
               step, not two steps. The first lane whose injection point sat in
               a process holding WRITE-scoped Cloudflare tokens for both
               accounts: the job is cloudflare-prod-write and calls
               cloudflare-tokens-from-kv with `scope: write`, which exports
               CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_FFC and _CM through GITHUB_ENV, so the
               credential in reach appears in no `env:` block in the file.
               Measured in both branches: the payload wrote the write-scoped
               token to a file, the callee was handed a legal domain, and the
               step exited 0. Its `account` / `zone_type` stay interpolated and
               are not findings — both are `type: choice`.

      -103     burned down: `domain` moved to step-level `env:` in all four pwsh
               bodies, and `domain` + `issue_number` in the `github-script` one.
               The widest entry in the freeze by blast radius — SIX call sites,
               FIVE jobs, TWO distinct gated write environments
               (cloudflare-prod-write twice, m365-prod twice) — so one payload
               ran four times under two production credentials on one approval.
               The first lane with a `github-script` site, and the first where
               the credential is reachable BOTH ways: the Cloudflare jobs hide
               their tokens in GITHUB_ENV while both m365-prod steps name the
               Exchange Online certificate in the SAME step's `env:` as the
               injection point. `issue_number` is `type: number`, which is NOT a
               constrained type — GitHub validates `boolean` and `choice` only —
               so it was moved for the same reason as `domain`, not as a
               courtesy. Its four `boolean` inputs stay interpolated and are not
               findings.
      = 27 / 12
      -306     burned down: `mailboxes` / `since_days` moved to step-level
               `env:`. The credential in reach appears NOWHERE in the file —
               the preceding step mints a Graph bearer token from the OIDC
               login and exports it through GITHUB_ENV — so reading the step's
               own `env:` (L213) and grepping the body for `secrets.` (#1141)
               both score this workflow as holding nothing, and it is the
               workflow's ONLY credential. It is also the first lane whose
               injection point sat in SINGLE quotes, where `$( )` does not
               expand: the payload every earlier lane used is inert here and
               reports the pre-fix body as harmless, so the control had to
               close the quote, steal, and re-issue the legitimate call.
               Measured: the bearer token was written to a file, the scanner
               was then handed a legal mailbox list, and the step exited 0.
      = 26 / 11
      -119     burned down: `domains` / `target` moved to step-level `env:`. It
               writes `staging.<domain>` in every FFC-EX zone across BOTH
               Cloudflare accounts on cloudflare-prod-write, with the
               write-scoped tokens arriving through GITHUB_ENV. The first lane
               where the remedy every earlier one used would have been WRONG:
               `domains` is `required: false` with an empty default and a
               documented fallback to a 13-domain list, so a fail-closed guard
               on empty breaks the common path. It keeps the fallback and omits
               `Target` from the splat when blank rather than passing an empty
               string, because the callee already resolves the canonical Pages
               host (#778). `dry_run` stays interpolated: `type: boolean`.

      -205     burned down: `deptid` / `client_id` moved to step-level `env:`

               the WHMCS API credential the preceding `whmcs-secrets-from-kv`
               action exports through GITHUB_ENV is the workflow's ONLY
               credential — invisible to both the L213 `env:` read and the
               #1141 `secrets.` grep. Its injection point sat in SINGLE quotes
               like 306, so the `$( )` payload is inert and the control had to
               close the quote and re-open the array. Measured: the WHMCS secret
               was written to a file, the callee was handed a legal deptid, and
               the step exited 0. `priority` (choice) and `dry_run` (boolean)

      -101     burned down: `domain` moved to step-level `env:` in all FIVE pwsh
               bodies and `issue_number` in the `github-script` body — six call
               sites in four jobs off one dispatch, the widest entry left after
               103. It is the lane where the #1188 reachability index gave the
               MISLEADING answer rather than merely a partial one: asked about
               101 it named two `cloudflare` steps and reported nothing at the
               two `m365` sites, which are the sites carrying `m365-prod` and
               so the only reason 101 was a `[W]` entry at all. An L213 read and
               a `secrets.` grep agree with it, and all three are wrong the same
               way — the preceding step is `azure/login@v3` and both bodies then
               run `az account get-access-token`, so the credential is a CLI
               SESSION rather than a value in a variable, and every sweep the
               burn-down has built is defined over variables. Measured with
               every credential variable removed from the environment: the
               payload ran `az` itself, wrote a Graph bearer token to a file,
               the callee was then handed a legal domain, and the step exited 0.

               invisible to both the L213 `env:` read and the #1141 `secrets.`
               grep, as 205's was. Its injection point sat in SINGLE quotes, so
               the `$( )` payload is inert and the control had to close the
               quote and the hashtable and re-open both. Measured: the WHMCS
               secret was written to a file, the callee was then handed a legal
               domain, and the step exited 0. It is the first lane where the
               fail-closed guard fixes a defect the interpolation was HIDING
               rather than one the remedy introduced: the body splats a
               hashtable onto a native `pwsh -File`, hashtable order is
               undefined, and a blank `Domain` was dropped so `-Domain`
               swallowed the next token — 3 of 8 runs bound
               `Domain=[-DryRun:True]` with `DryRun=[False]` at exit 0, the
               other 5 failed loudly. Ledger L254. `action` (choice) and
               `dry_run` (boolean) stay interpolated and are not findings.
      = 22 / 7
      -102     burned down: `domain` moved to step-level `env:` in both pwsh and
               both bash bodies, `domain` + `issue_number` in the
               `github-script` body. FOUR jobs, THREE environments —
               whmcs-prod twice, cloudflare-prod-write twice,
               cloudflare-prod-read once — so one payload ran under two
               production credential families on one approval, with both the
               WHMCS and the Cloudflare credentials arriving through GITHUB_ENV
               and so invisible to the L213 `env:` read and the #1141
               `secrets.` grep alike.

               It is the lane that showed a freeze entry is not the whole call
               site. The four `inputs.` sites this list named are the FIRST hop:
               `inputs.domain` is published as a step output and
               re-interpolated into SEVEN more script bodies, and
               `.Trim().ToLowerInvariant().Trim('.')` removes nothing that
               matters. Measured — with `Metadata` remedied the house way, the
               payload arrived as data THERE, went verbatim into GITHUB_OUTPUT,
               and executed one step later at
               `$domain = "${{ steps.meta.outputs.domain }}"`: WHMCS secret
               stolen, `-Domain` still bound to a legal `example.org`, exit 0.
               So a lane fixing only what this guard can see would have removed
               the entry, gone green, and left the injection working. The guard
               is defined over `inputs.X` and cannot see the laundering; filed
               as #1233 rather than absorbed here. Ledger L255.
      = 21 / 6
      -116     burned down: `domain` moved to step-level `env:`, and the
               job-summary line that re-interpolated the SAME input reads the
               local `$domain` instead — two call sites off one entry, both in
               DOUBLE quotes, on whmcs-prod. No quote breakout was needed:
               `$( )` expands there. Measured on the shipped body with `domain`
               = `example.org$($null = Set-Content -Path <sentinel> -Value
               $env:WHMCS_API_SECRET)` — WHMCS secret stolen, callee still
               handed a legal `Domain=[example.org]`, step exited 0. The
               credential is the workflow's only one and arrives through
               GITHUB_ENV from `whmcs-secrets-from-kv`, so both recommended
               sweeps read the file as holding nothing.

               It is the lane that BOUNDS L214 instead of re-confirming it.
               Every earlier lane's fail-closed guard closed a silent shift the
               remedy introduces; here nothing silent exists to close, because
               every other element the body splats is a SWITCH and a switch
               cannot absorb a value. Measured with the guard stripped: unset ->
               `Missing an argument for parameter 'Domain'`, empty -> `Cannot
               bind argument to parameter 'Domain' because it is an empty
               string`, both rc 1. The guard stays for attribution, not for the
               shift — and saying otherwise would have been a claim inherited
               from 118 rather than measured here. Ledger L260. `mode` (choice)
