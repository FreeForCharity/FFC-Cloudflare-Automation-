"""Tests for the laundered dispatch-input guard (#1233).

The subject is `scripts/check-workflow-laundered-input-interpolation.py`. What
it claims: a free-text `workflow_dispatch` input never reaches a `run:` or
`github-script` body through a step or job OUTPUT either, except for the hops
frozen in `KNOWN_LAUNDERED` — and that freeze is exact in both directions.

The class it covers is the one that fails in the FLATTERING direction. Moving an
input into step-level `env:` is the remedy the sibling guard prescribes, and it
is also what deletes the `inputs.X` reference the sibling is defined over. So a
lane can fix every call site the sibling names, delete its freeze entry, go
green on every check in the repo, and leave a working injection under a
production credential. Four of the five workflows this guard reports are absent
from the sibling's freeze today.

Designed against the two failure modes this repo keeps hitting:

* **Vacuous green.** A sweep whose input set silently empties passes by
  inspecting nothing. `test_the_scan_sees_real_workflows` and
  `test_the_taint_engine_finds_real_taint` pin the input, and the mutation
  tests assert a CONTROL exits 0 immediately before each mutation (ledger L209)
  so a red is attributable to the mutation and not to the tree.
* **A guard that cannot fail.** Reading the checker proves it is wired, never
  that it detects (AGENTS.md). Every claim below that says "X makes it exit 1"
  is exercised by actually doing X — including reintroducing 102's real hop,
  which is what #1233 requires.

Mutations are applied to a COPY in a temp directory, never to the tree, so
restore fidelity is never in question (ledger L182, and the CRLF half of the
same trap on the Conductor's host).
