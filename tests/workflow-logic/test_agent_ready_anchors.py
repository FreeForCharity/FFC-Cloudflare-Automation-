"""Unit tests for scripts/audit-agent-ready-anchors.py (#1193).

#1193 measured two detectors against the live backlog and only one survived:

  * "a file this issue cites changed since it was filed" flagged **20 of 52**
    open `agent-ready` issues, **1 real** -- Dependabot bumps and one
    comment-fix commit to `run_all.py` light up a third of the backlog;
  * "the anchor the issue quotes is gone from the file it quotes it from"
    agreed with the manual verdict on all three issues it was hand-checked
    against.

So the tests here are mostly about the ways this decays back into the first
detector, or into noise. The discriminating one is
`test_ac4_a_changed_file_whose_anchor_survives_reports_nothing`: #1060's cited
guard file *did* change, and the anchor is still in it, and a detector that
flags on file-change alone passes AC1-AC3 and fails only that. It is written
first for that reason.

No network and no fixtures on disk. The tree is injected (`FakeTree`), so these
tests do not decay when the real `105-manage-record.yml` changes again, and the
transport is injected at `_request`, so the real Link-header pagination and the
real shape-check are the code under test rather than a mock of them.

Locked down here:
  * the #1077 shape reports, and the same body against PRE-fix content does not
    -- the guard proved to fail without its fix (L47);
  * an anchor still present anywhere it is cited stays quiet, whatever else
    moved in the file;
  * an issue's own `bash` verification block is never an anchor, and neither is
    a bare identifier, a sentence, a path citation, or a span under 12 chars --
    each of those is a false positive that would land on nearly every issue;
  * a cited path that git has no history for is a **proposed** file and is
    silent, not `PATH GONE`: issues asking for a new script name one, and this
    sweep's own issue (#1193) is one of them;
  * every failed enumeration exits NON-ZERO -- no token, a non-list payload. A
    sweep with no verdict must never report a clean one;
  * the exit-code decision is asserted in-process via `has_findings`, because a
    clean-fixture subprocess run only ever exercises the zero path and would
    pass against a `main` that returned 0 unconditionally (#912/#927);
  * `no_anchor_extracted` is counted and printed but is NOT a finding -- it is
    the technique's stated limit, and burying it would make the rest unreadable;
  * the script issues no write, which no fixture can demonstrate.
