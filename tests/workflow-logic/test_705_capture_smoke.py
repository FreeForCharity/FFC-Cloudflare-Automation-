"""End-to-end smoke run of the capture, offline, against a synthetic WordPress.

`capture()` is roughly 750 lines that the script's own `--self-test` never
enters, because that suite exercises pure functions. Two defects have now
shipped through that gap, and the second is the reason this module exists: a
tally was declared beside the pass that fills it in and reported on in an
earlier pass, which is a temporal dead zone `node --check` cannot see. It
surfaced as `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'imageRecode' before
initialization` six minutes into a live crawl of a charity's site.

The fixture replaces `globalThis.fetch` via `node --import`, so the capture
keeps its real request path, redirect handling and timeouts and simply gets
synthetic answers. No listening socket, no DNS, no loopback address — which
matters, because the alternative (an `--origin` override pointed at
127.0.0.1) would mean weakening the private-host guard in a tool that fetches
operator-supplied URLs, to make it testable.

A static use-before-declaration scan was tried first and abandoned: without a
real parser it reported three false positives on the tree it was written
against (an object key and two names inside string literals), and a checker
that cries wolf is not a guard.

The fixture is deliberately a hostile WordPress, reproducing in miniature
every shape this migration has been bitten by: a stale `home` naming a domain
the site does not serve, a front page that redirects there, content hidden
behind JavaScript, a stylesheet only an inline script names, oversized PNGs,
and a reference the origin itself 404s.
