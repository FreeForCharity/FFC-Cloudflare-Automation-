"""Guard: a dry run must not mint a write credential or park on a write gate (#983).

`dry_run` was enforced at the **step** level in 701/702/720 and never at the
job level, so a `dry_run=true` dispatch still started the job, still parked the
run on a reviewer-gated write environment, and still pulled a write-scoped
credential out of Key Vault — and only *then* did the individual steps decide
to do nothing. Three costs, in the order they bite:

1. **The dry path is unverifiable unattended.** A rehearsal that needs the same
   human approval as the live run is not a rehearsal. Run 30708948816 (701,
   `dry_run=true`) got as far as `dns` waiting on `cloudflare-prod-write` and
   had to be cancelled — which is why this check had been owed since #858 and
   deferred for four Conductor runs.
2. **Dry runs pollute the gate queue** with rows indistinguishable at a glance
   from a real pending write.
3. **A write credential is materialised for a run that writes nothing.**

## The two legitimate remedies — skipping is only one of them

`111-dns-create-redirect-rule.yml` is the reference: an **ungated `preview`
job** does the rehearsal and the gated `apply` job carries
`if: inputs.dry_run == false`. The invariant this module enforces is the
credential one — *no write-scoped credential on a dry run* — and a workflow can
satisfy it two ways:

- **Move the rehearsal out** of the gated job into an ungated one, then skip
  the gated remainder (111's shape). This is what 701's `dns` now does, via the
  `dns_preview` job on `cloudflare-prod-read`.
- **Skip the gated job outright**, but ONLY when some other, ungated job already
  performs the *same* rehearsal — which is far rarer than it looks. The first
  draft of #983's fix claimed 701's `zone_check` and 720's `preflight` qualified.
  Neither does: `zone_check` emits four booleans from `cloudflare-zone-get.ps1`
  and never computes the apex/www plan, and `preflight` only checks that a repo
  name is free. `test_a_skipped_job_has_a_real_rehearsal_counterpart` now makes
  the claim checkable instead of rhetorical — the named counterpart must be
  ungated, hold no write credential, and invoke the same script.

The distinction matters, and getting it backwards is destructive rather than
merely useless. Two workflows in this repo prove it:

- **702's `clone-deploy`** *is* its own rehearsal — a dry run clones the live
  site with httrack, integrates it into the Next.js app and runs a real
  `next build` plus the self-containment gate, withholding only the commit and
  PR. Its `dry_run` defaults to **true**, so blindly adding a skip term would
  make the workflow's default dispatch a green no-op. It needs the 111 split
  (ungated clone/build, gated publish), which is a restructure, not a one-line
  `if:`.
- **736's `archive`** is worse: its dry run *is the required safety evidence*.
  `736`'s preflight refuses a live archive unless a successful `dry_run=true`
  run of 736 for the same repo exists within 48h (2026-07-18 incident). Skipping
  the gated job on a dry run would still leave a green run for the preflight to
  find while producing none of the preview an operator is told to review —
  converting a two-step safety control into a rubber stamp.

So this module does NOT assert "every write-credentialed job is skipped on a
dry run". It asserts that the set which is, and the set which is not, are both
**exactly enumerated** — the repo's `DISPATCH_ONLY_GATED_READS` convention, for
the same reason: a count is not evidence, the list is.

## Scope discovered while fixing #983

#983's table named five jobs, derived from the three workflows a Conductor run
happened to dispatch. Parsing every workflow instead — which is what acceptance
criterion 4 asks for, so "a seventh copy is caught" — the real population is
**27 credential-bearing jobs across 23 workflows**. Exactly one — 701's `dns` —
is fixed here, because it is the only one whose rehearsal could be relocated to
an ungated read lane today. The GitHub-side jobs (701 `repo`/`content`, 720
`create-repo`) need `github-prod-read`, which exists (#834) but whose credential
`read-all-cbm-github-pat` is dead (#848). The rest are enumerated in
`KNOWN_UNGUARDED` below, so the number is visible instead of implied.

def test_string_valued_dry_run_never_uses_equals_false():
    """`== false` is unsafe when the value can be a STRING, not when it can be null.

    Corrected on review of #985 — the first version of this test asserted that
    `== false` breaks on 701's `issues` / `repository_dispatch` paths because
    the empty `inputs` context makes it FALSE. That is backwards. Per the
    documented casting table for loose equality, **Null → 0** and
    **`false` → 0**, so `null == false` is `0 == 0` → **TRUE**: the job RUNS on
    an issue-triggered run, which is the desired behaviour. (An empty string
    also casts to 0, so the claim fails under that reading too.)

    The real hazard is the string. A **String** casts to "any legal JSON number
    format, otherwise NaN" — so `"false"` → NaN, and `"false" == false` is
    FALSE. That arises two ways, both live in this repo's future:

    - reading `github.event.inputs.<name>`, which is always a string, even for
      a `type: boolean` input;
    - retyping an input from `boolean` to `choice` / `string`.

    In either case a `== false` guard SKIPS the gated job on a **live** run —
    a missed DNS repoint or repo create that reports success. `!= true`
    survives both (NaN != 1), which is why the #983 fixes use it.

    So this test polices the shapes that actually carry a string, and leaves
    `== false` alone where the input is a declared boolean read via `inputs.`
    (111, 122, 742, 103 — all correct).
