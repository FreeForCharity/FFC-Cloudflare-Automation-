"""Unit tests for the in-step GitHub-PAT liveness probe (#1102).

Sixteen credential steps across fourteen workflows load a GitHub PAT from Key
Vault. Until #1102 each guarded it with `if [ -z "$token" ]` only -- and
**emptiness is not the failure mode that happens**. A revoked-but-present PAT
cleared that check and failed two to four steps later inside a script, naming
the wrong subsystem: 502's `deliver` job failed 11 consecutive times with a bare
`401 Bad credentials` from `generate-agentic-os-status.py`, and the log's most
greppable line was the *echoed* `run:` body saying the secret "came back empty
from Key Vault", which named vault RBAC as the cause of a revoked token. Nine
days were read that way (#848).

What is asserted here, in two layers:

  * **Shape**, over every one of the 16 steps: the probe exists, sits after the
    `::add-mask::` and before the `GITHUB_ENV` export (so a dead token is never
    exported), keeps the emptiness branch with a distinguishable message, names
    the secret and the status code, and never routes the token into output.
  * **Behaviour**, by running the real step bodies under the shell the runner
    uses (`bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail`) with `az` and `curl` shims.
    Shape tests cannot see the failure this class actually produces: under an
    inherited `-e`, `code="$(curl ...)"` without `|| true` aborts the step before
    its own branch runs, so the guard would be present, unreachable, and green
    (L73). `test_unreachable_endpoint_fails_closed` is that proof -- delete the
    `|| true` from a step body and it fails with an empty stdout.

No network: `curl` here is a shim that records its argv and returns the status
the test asks for. `test_real_curl_prints_000_on_a_refused_connection` is the
control on that shim's premise -- it exercises the *real* curl against a closed
local port to confirm the `000` + non-zero-exit pair the shim simulates.
