"""Guards for 703's checkout freshness.

703 is a weekly cron whose only job sits on the gated `github-prod`
environment. A cron cannot approve its own gate, so the run waits — and a
run's default checkout is pinned to the SHA it was CREATED at, not the SHA it
eventually runs at. `peter-evans/create-pull-request` branches from whatever is
checked out, so the data PR inherits that staleness.

Measured 2026-09-07: run 11 was created 2026-08-31 and approved seven days
later. It checked out `2ceb54d`, and the PR it opened (#1249) was **133 commits
behind `main`** against Phantom Revert Guard's threshold of 5. The generation
itself was green; the PR simply could not merge without a hand-run
update-branch. That is not a one-off — it recurs every week the gate is
answered late, which is the normal case for a gate a human answers when they
get to it.

The fix is `ref: main` on the checkout, which resolves at checkout time.

These guards are deliberately about the WORKFLOW FILE rather than about a
script's behaviour: the defect lives in the absence of one YAML key, and the
regression is someone dropping it. A test that ran the generator would pass
either way.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The 601 decoupling.
#
# 703 used to dispatch 601 from inside its own gated job and block on
# `gh run watch`. 601 sits on `wpmudev-prod`, which has a required reviewer, so
# the second approval prompt only APPEARED ~10 minutes after this job's own was
# granted -- and if nobody answered it, the step waited until it timed out,
# wasting the approval already spent on this run. Measured 2026-09-07: the
# operator approved 703, and 601 surfaced as a separate prompt ten minutes later.
#
# 703 now reuses 601's newest successful export and dispatches the next one
# from its LAST step, fire-and-forget. That asks for 601's approval at the one
# moment an operator is provably present -- they answered this job's own gate
# minutes earlier -- while nothing in the job depends on the answer.
#
# The reviewer on `wpmudev-prod` is deliberately KEPT: this is about when the
# approval is asked for, not about removing it.
#
# A cron on 601 would put both prompts up simultaneously and is what the first
# draft of this change did. `test_gated_env_hygiene.py` rejects it -- a
# Reads-level job on a schedule AND a reviewer gate parks at `waiting` with
# nobody watching -- and that guard deliberately has no allowlist for the
# scheduled case, so the dispatch-last arrangement is what shipped.
