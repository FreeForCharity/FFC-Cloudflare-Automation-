"""Tests for `scripts/verify-conductor-hooks.py` (#1042, ledger L218).

The subject is a verifier, so the tests are mostly about the two ways a verifier
is worthless: it passes a workspace that is not wired (false green), or it fails
one that is (false red). Both are covered, and the false-green half is covered
against *stubbed guards* rather than against a missing config -- because a
missing config is the easy case and a neutered guard is the one a config diff
cannot see.

Every fixture is built in a `TemporaryDirectory`. Nothing here mutates the repo
tree: the in-place-mutate-and-restore habit is what CLAUDE.md/L182 records as
restoring against the wrong baseline, and a test module that leaves a stray file
in the working tree is #1023.
