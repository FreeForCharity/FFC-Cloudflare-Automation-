# --- child process environments ---------------------------------------------
#
# A child environment is INHERITED and then layered on, never built from
# nothing. Handed a dict containing only the variables a test cares about,
# node aborts during startup on Windows — it cannot initialize without the
# platform's own variables (SYSTEMROOT above all) and dies before any test
# logic runs, so the module reports `harness crashed:` rather than a result
# (#943). 26 modules were unrunnable on a Windows host for this reason while
# staying green on Linux and in CI, which is why nothing reported it.
#
# The cause is the *minimal dict*, not the POSIX-looking `/usr/bin:/bin` that
# used to be written into it: #943 measured both, and rewriting PATH alone
# changed nothing while inheriting fixed every crash.
#
# PATH is assembled with os.pathsep and keeps the inherited PATH as its tail,
# so a harness directory still shadows the real `gh`/`curl`/`sleep` while the
# platform's own directories stay reachable. The hardcoded `/usr/bin:/bin`
# tails are dropped rather than translated: on POSIX they are already in the
# inherited PATH, and on Windows they were never anything but noise.
# --- RUNNER_TEMP: one scratch directory per test PROCESS (#1247) -------------
#
# Seven workflows wrote to fixed `/tmp/<name>` paths in their `run:` bodies, and
# the harness executes those bodies verbatim. On a GitHub-hosted runner that is
# invisible — one job per VM, so the paths cannot collide. Locally two copies of
# the same module clobber each other's state, and the failure never names
# concurrency: `/tmp/entries.json` is rewritten between a write and a read
# (`KeyError`) or read mid-truncation (`JSONDecodeError`).
#
# That matters beyond a flaky test because the L191 treatment/control comparison
# in AGENTS.md runs the composed suite and the control suite AT THE SAME TIME.
# The contamination is nondeterministic about which side it lands on, so it
# manufactures a difference where none exists — and that difference reads as a
# regression introduced by the PR under review. Measured on 2026-09-07 composing
# #1238 + #1245 + #1246: `test_738` failed on the composed side alone, three
# clean PRs looked like one broken audit, and a serial re-run showed identical
# failure sets on both sides.
#
# The bodies now write under `"${RUNNER_TEMP:-/tmp}"`, so isolation is this
# variable. It is set per process rather than per test: a step body writes a
# file that the assertions read AFTER the step returns (120's dispatch TSV,
# 738's entries.json), so a directory torn down with each invocation would take
# the evidence with it.
#
# It is set UNCONDITIONALLY, not with setdefault. A real runner exports
# RUNNER_TEMP job-wide, so inheriting it would put every module in one job back
# in a shared directory — the exact state this removes.

# the content minus its final byte(s). 738 published a canonical hash nobody could
# reproduce with `sha256sum`, and its byte-identity audit reported a
# trailing-newline-only difference as MATCHING (#893).
#
# It lives HERE, not in a test module, because two modules check it — the
# tree-wide scan in `test_lessons_ledger.py` and the step-local guard in
# `test_738_fleet_smoke_drift.py`. They started as two regexes for one rule, and
# they promptly drifted: round 2 of #895 anchored the ledger copy and left 738's
# flagging `cat "$file" | sha256sum`, a false positive on correct code that was
# found only by a later review round. One rule, one implementation.
#
# Anchored on the EMITTING command, which is what separates the defect from code
# that looks like it. `cat "$file" | sha256sum` and `(cd d && cat f) | sha256sum`
# stream the file's real bytes and strip nothing; `printf '%s' "$out" | sha256sum`
